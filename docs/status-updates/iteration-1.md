## TODO

* Consider reviewing more thorough electron/create-react-app setup documentation: https://mmazzarolo.com/blog/2021-08-12-building-an-electron-application-using-create-react-app/

## October 31

Progress:

* Completed planning tasks (design document, project epics, iteration 1 issues)
* Begin work on Electron project
  * https://www.section.io/engineering-education/desktop-application-with-react/
  * https://medium.com/@kitze/%EF%B8%8F-from-react-to-an-electron-app-ready-for-production-a0468ecb1da3
  * Complicated significantly by using Docker devcontainer. Required xwindows setup, seccomp configuration, etc. Probably not worth it in the end, but it's what I had.
* Decided not to setup Yarn 2/plug-n-play to avoid wasting more time on tooling.
* Found information on GitHub publishing:
