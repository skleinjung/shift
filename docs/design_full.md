# Shift - Design Document ()

Unending hack-and-slash adventure with extensive character customization.

## Overview

*Shift* is an homage to classic rogue-like games such as *NetHack*, but tailored to people who do not enjoy character permadeath. It is an open-ended game that allows players to explore an ever-expanding, procedurally generated world while building and customizing a character over many play sessions.

Shift is a set in a faux-medieval fantasy setting where a magical calamity has pulled most of the world into a separate dimension. The player must navigate this shattered landscape in order to help what's left of humanity survive. Once they leave the protective walls of the city, however, they will encounter monsters and unnatural wonders that will test their capabilities. Without fail, the player finds themselves inexplicably wandering back in town, seemingly having been banished from a world that recognizes them as alien.

### Influences

Shift will leverage tried and true mechanics from the games and genres that inspired it:

* **Procedural Dungeons**: To allow long-term replayability, dungeons and other areas will be procedurally generated.

* **RPG Elements**: Shift will allow a character to gain in power as they adventure, and the player will be able to make meaningful choices about how to enhance their character as they level up.

* **Random Loot**: In addition to gaining intrinsic power as they level, characters in Shift will acquire a variety of equipment and other items to enhance their abilities.

* **Limited Turns**: Shift aims to build a sense of urgency by limiting the number of turns a player can make while exploring. This forces the player to be planful without creating the anxiety that strict time-based limits can cause.

* **Town Building**

### Innovations

Shift aims to build upon its influences by innovating in a number of key areas:

* **Evolving World**: As they explore the shattered world, the player will be able to undo some of the damage caused by the calamity. This will open new opportunities for adventure and allow the survivors to expand their territory.

* **Metamorphosis**: The alien world of Shift will allow players to unlock much greater enhancements to their body than the typical stat increases common in RPGs. The laws of nature do not apply in this realm, and those brave enough to do so will be able to adopt inhuman characteristics and mutations to increase their power.

* **Hidden Depth**: Shift will appear extremely simple at first glance, with almost no UI or gameplay elements apparent. As a player's adventure unfolds, however, they will become increasingly aware of systems that were previously hidden.

* **Item Empowerment**

## Player Choice

The player takes on the role of a "Shifter" -- someone who is able to pass through the misty borders of civilization into the remains of the world beyond. Shifters are the only source of resources that exist beyond the bounds of humanity's last city, and because of this are afforded a great degree of respect and power. As they explore the wastelands, however, the player will begin to uncover clues to a forgotten past that beckons them to something much greater than simple scavenging.

Players are able to leverage the freedom of being a Shifter in several ways: choosing where and how to explore, advancing their character, and allocating recovered resources for use within the town.
