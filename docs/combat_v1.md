# Original Combat Design

This is kept in case the new system is a disaster.

## Combat

Combat in Shift is resolved using a combination of dice and cards. Opportunity dice are used to determine how favorable the combat conditions are for a character each turn, and then cards representing tactics are played to take advantage of those conditions.

### Opportunity

When attacking, a character rolls combat dice equal to their Melee or Missile attribute -- whichever applies to the attack. The result indicates a base attack and defense strength for the turn, as well as how favorable or unfavorable the battlefield conditions are for the character this round. This *opportunity* value indicates the maximum number of tactic cards a player may play from their hand.

Combat dice are six-sided, with the following faces (🗡️ = Attack, 🛡️ = Defense, 👁️ = Opportunity):

* 🗡️ + 👁️👁️
* 🛡️ + 👁️👁️
* 🗡️🗡️ + 👁️
* 🛡️🛡️ + 👁️
* 🗡️🗡️🗡️
* 🛡️🛡️🛡️
