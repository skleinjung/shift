# Shift: Prelude

*Shift: Prelude* is a hack-and-slash RPG that allows a player to search procedurally generated dungeons for adventure and treasure while uncovering a story of loss and redemption.

Shift is a Thrashplay game developed by me, [Sean Kleinjung](https://github.com/skleinjung/). It is the first project in my "game a month" series, where I will be experimenting with a new game concept every month and sharing the process of creating (hopefully) interesting games. As an extra bonus this project has been entered in the [Crunchless Challenge on itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/crunchless-challenge), and so&mdash;if all goes well&mdash;will be formally published and available for download in December!
